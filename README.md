Before running BARCODE we recommend going through our detailed **[BARCODE 2.0 Tutorial](https://www.livingbam.org/barcode-2-tutorial)** which includes test data. It should take 10-15 seconds on a standard desktop computer to analyze the test data in the tutorial using the software.

# Installation
The BARCODE source code can be directly downloaded on any system running Python 3.12 or later from the [BARCODE-HTP Github repository](https://github.com/BARCODE-HTP/barcode). To install the required packages, you can use PIP to install them using the following command: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```. Keep in mind that this code was developed in Python 3.12 -- versions of Python prior to 3.12 may not be able to run this program from the source code. If running from source and an error indicates that the `av` package is missing, install it with ```pip install av```.  To run BARCODE, navigate to the source code directory in the terminal and run the command: ```python main.py``` or ```python3 main.py```.

# Usage
## Data Preparation
High-quality microscopy videos with minimal spurious signals should be used. If needed, videos should be cropped or trimmed prior to analysis.  BARCODE accepts files in in TIFF and ND2 file formats. If files you wish to process are not in either format, you will need to convert them to a TIFF file using ImageJ/FIJI.

## Running BARCODE & User Settings
Navigate to the source code directory in the terminal and run the command: ```python main.py``` or ```python3 main.py```. A window will appear with the graphical user interface (GUI). The user inputs are described below. When finished specifying the operational settings, click "Run" to begin the BARCODE program. 


Each branch also contains a live preview of the output, showing visualizations of the Image Binarization, Optical Flow, and Intensity Distribution images. These are updated by modifying the parameters below, and also contain a slider enabling easy visualization throughout the video.

### Binarization Settings
The Image Binarization branch takes frames from the original video and binarizes those frames. Following this, the binarized video is broken into connected components, with the growth of "voids" (connected components labelled as 0) and "islands" (connected components labelled as 1) measured. A live preview of the binarization is shown in the program to enable qualitative analysis of the effect of the binarization and the sensitivity to the binarization threshold.

| Setting Name | Description | Limits | Default Value |
| - | - | - | - |
| Binarization Threshold | Controls the threshold percentage of the mean which binarizes the image; offset parameter determines the binarization threshold for a given frame as $(1 + \text{offset}) * \overline{B(i)}$, where $\overline{B(i)}$ represents the mean pixel intensity for frame $i$ | (-1, 1) | 0.1 |
| Binning Ratio | Controls the extent of spatial downsampling performed on the image before binarization; averages windows of $p \times p$ pixels to reduce size of data | (1, 8) | 2 |
| Output Unit Conversion | Changes selected image binarization area metrics from field-of-view percentage units to physical area units based on the selected length unit | (On, Off) | Off |
| Frame Step | Controls the interval between binarized frames; affects speed of program, with larger intervals decreasing program runtime at potential loss of accuracy | (1, 100) | 10 |
| Fraction of Frames Evaluated | Used for determining frames for averaging in calculation of initial maximum island area and maximum island/void area change; not used for calculation of maximum island/void area; decreasing this results in fewer frames being used for these averages, at the cost of more sensitivity to noise | (0.01, 0.25) | 0.05 |

### Optical Flow Settings
The optical flow module takes frames from a video file and calculates the optical flow field using Farneback's Optical Flow algorithm.

| Setting Name | Description | Limits | Default Value |
| - | - | - | - |
| Frame Step | Controls the interval between frames with which the flow field is calculated; larger values are less prone to noise, but have less precision | (1, 100) | 10 |
| Optical Flow Window Size | Controls the window size used to compute the flow fields, described further in the [OpenCV documentation here](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/dc/d6b/group__video__track.html#ga5d10ebbd59fe09c5f650289ec0ece5af) | (1, 1000) | 32 |
| Downsample | Controls the interval between pixels that the flow field is sampled at; larger values are less prone to noise but have less precision | (1, 1000) | 8 |
| Fraction of Frames Evaluated | Used for determining frames for averaging in calculation of speed change; not used for calculation of other optical flow metrics; decreasing this results in fewer frames being used for these averages, at the cost of more sensitivity to noise | (0.01, 0.25) | 0.05 |

### Edge Segmentation Settings
The Edge Segmentation branch is also the BARCODE mechanics extension. Its default
MVP uses adaptive local thresholding plus opening/closing morphology. A legacy
Canny mode and an optional learned-model plug-in are available. Boundaries are
derived from the resulting mask; Canny is used only when the mask is empty.
Enable the branch under **Select Branches**.

| Setting Name | Description | Default Value |
| - | - | - |
| Segmentation Method | `adaptive`, `canny`, or optional `model` plug-in | adaptive |
| Adaptive Block Size / C | Local neighborhood and threshold offset | 31 / 5 |
| Invert Foreground | Segment dark rather than bright features | Off |
| Canny Lower / Upper Threshold | Fallback/legacy edge thresholds | 50 / 150 |
| Opening / Closing | Remove noise and bridge gaps in the mask | 3/1 and 5/2 |
| Minimum Segment Area | Ignore contours smaller than this area in pixels | 100 |
| Deformation Method | Dense Farneback flow or phase-correlation registration | flow |
| Strain Tensor | Infinitesimal (`small`) or Green-Lagrange (`finite`) strain | small |
| Crack Mask Inversion | Skeletonize mask background instead of foreground | Off |
| Frame Step | Analyze every Nth frame | 10 |
| Fraction of Frames Evaluated | Beginning/end fraction used for edge-density change | 0.05 |

The mechanics computations and exported evidence are:

| Capability | Computation | Evidence |
| - | - | - |
| Segmentation | Adaptive threshold + morphology; optional model plug-in | Mask, confidence, QC |
| Edge detection | Exterior contours from mask; Canny fallback | Red boundary overlay + contour coordinates |
| Curvature / curl | Signed contour curvature; signed displacement curl | Signed maps and summaries |
| Shape change | Area, perimeter, circularity, elongation, angle | Normalized delta time series |
| Deformation | Optical flow or registration | Displacement vector field |
| Strain | Displacement gradients, small or finite tensor | `strain_xx`, `strain_yy`, `strain_xy` maps |
| Crack geometry | Skeleton graph length; width = 2 × distance-to-boundary | Length, contour length, width map, branches, tips and tip motion |

With **Save Reduced Data Structures** enabled, `SegmentationData.csv` contains
the binary boundary and mask, `MechanicsTimeSeries.csv` contains interpretable
frame measurements, and `Mechanics Evidence/*.npz` contains lossless compressed
mask, confidence, contour coordinates, curvature, skeleton, crack-width,
displacement, curl, and strain maps. Crack width is sampled on the skeleton from
the Euclidean distance transform, while crack length uses weighted 8-neighbor
graph paths (unit and diagonal steps). All lengths are converted using the
configured physical pixel size.

Open an evidence archive with NumPy:

```python
import numpy as np

with np.load("Mechanics Evidence/frame_00000.npz") as evidence:
    print(evidence.files)
    crack_width = evidence["crack_width"]
    skeleton = evidence["crack_skeleton"]
    contour_points = evidence["contour_points"]
    contour_offsets = evidence["contour_offsets"]
```

`contour_points[contour_offsets[i]:contour_offsets[i + 1]]` reconstructs contour
`i`. Pair archives contain `displacement`, `curl`, `strain_xx`, `strain_yy`, and
`strain_xy`. NumPy arrays can be displayed with `matplotlib.pyplot.imshow` or
converted to CSV with `numpy.savetxt`.
The settings tab provides a live three-panel preview of the original frame,
mask boundary, and filled segmentation mask. Parameters update immediately, and
the preview reports QC, shape, curvature, and crack measurements.

#### Optional segmentation model plug-in

Enter a callable as `package.module:function`. It must accept one two-dimensional
frame and return either `mask` or `(mask, confidence)`. Both arrays must match the
input frame; confidence values are clipped to `[0, 1]`.

```python
def segment(frame):
    mask = my_model.predict(frame) > 0.5
    confidence = my_model.confidence(frame)
    return mask, confidence
```

### Intensity Distribution Settings
The intensity distribution module takes frames from a video and creates an intensity distribution histogram. The kurtosis, median skewness, and mode skewness are then calculated from this distribution.

| Setting Name | Description | Limits | Default Value |
| - | - | - | - |
| Frame Step | Controls the interval between frames for which the intensity distributions are calculated; affects speed of program, with larger intervals decreasing program runtime | (1, 100) | 10 |
| Distribution Number of Bins | Controls the number of bins in histogram; increasing/decreasing the number of bins may result in binning artifacts that affect accuracy of intensity distribution | (100, 500) | 300 |
| Distribution Noise Threshold | Controls the minimum normalized probability in the intensity distribution; probabilities below this threshold are set to 0 and the distribution is renormalized; increasing/decreasing this will affect the sensitivity of the metrics to noise, which is particularly relevant for higher pixel intensity values | (0.00001, 0.01) | 0.0005 |
| Fraction of Frames Evaluated | Used for determining frames for averaging in calculation of kurtosis/median skewness/mode skewness change; not used for calculation of maximum kurtosis/median skewness/mode skewness metrics; decreasing this results in fewer frames being used for these averages, at the cost of more sensitivity to noise | (0.01, 0.25) | 0.05 |

# Outputs
## Metrics
Each module contributes testable summary metrics to the BARCODE analysis. They are described below:
### Binarization Metrics
The Binarization module uses a binarization threshold (defined [above](#binarization-settings)) to convert each selected frame from a given video from grayscale to 0's and 1's. This binarized image is then segmented into "islands" (a region comprising of only 1's) and "voids" (a region comprising of only 0's). The following metrics are computed with respect to these definitions.
| Metric | Description  |
| - | - |
| **Connectivity** | The percentage of frames that are defined as "connected" (there exists a single island spanning from the top to bottom of the frame, or from the left to right of the frame) |
| **Maximum Island Area** | Fractional area of the largest island in the video; calculated by averaging fractional area of the largest island in each frame over the frames with the top 10% largest islands |
| **Maximum Void Area** | Fractional area of the largest void; calculated in a similar manner to the ***Maximum Island Area*** metric |
| **Maximum Island Area Change** | The percentage growth/shrinkage of the largest island; calculated by averaging the island area over the first *X* percent and last *X* percent of frames and calculating the difference between these two averages |
| **Maximum Void Area Change** | The percentage growth/shrinkage of the largest void; calculated in a similar manner to the ***Maximum Island Area Change*** metric |
| **Initial Maximum Island Area** | Fractional area of the largest island in the first *X* percent of frames; used as a measurement of the heterogeneity of the island areas in the frame |
| **Initial 2nd Maximum Island Area** | Fractional area of the second largest island in the first *X* percent of frames; used in combination with ***Initial Maximum Island Area*** as a measurement of the heterogeneity of the connected components in the frame |
| **Mean Island Anisotropy** | The average anisotropy of all islands in a given frame, averaged over all frames; calculated using the quotient of the major and minor axis lengths |
| **Mean Island Area** | The average fractional area of all islands in a given frame, averaged over all frames |
| **Total Island Area** | The total fractional area of all islands in a given frame, averaged over all frames |
| **Mean Island Separation** | The average distance between all islands in a given frame, averaged over all frames; calculated by calculating the distance between each island centroid |
| **Structural Correlation Length** | The distance $r$ where the average correlation in pixel intensity between two pixels separated by distance $r$ drops below $\frac{1}{e}$, averaged over all frames; calculated using Fast Fourier Transforms to determine the correlation and then radially averaged to find $r$, before averaging for all frames |

### Optical Flow Field Metrics
The Optical Flow module computes a "flow field" for pairs of frames as selected by the user, with each flow field consisting of a $m/p$ x $n/p$ grid of velocity vectors, where $m$ x $n$ are the dimensions of a given frame, and $p$ is the downsampling factor (defined [above](#optical-flow-settings)). The following metrics are computed with respect to these definitions.
| Metric | Description |
| - | - |
| **Speed** | The average speed over all flow fields in the video; calculated by taking the magnitude of each velocity vector and averaging over the flow field, before averaging the output of each flow field. |
| **Speed Change** | The change in the average speed throughout the video; calculated in a similar manner to the ***Maximum Island Area Change*** metrics. |
| **Mean Flow Direction** | The average direction of the velocity vectors throughout the video; calculated by normalizing the velocity vectors to unit vectors, then taking the average of the $x$ and $y$ components for each vector separately over all flow fields, and then taking the two-argument arctan2 function to calculate an average flow direction. |
| **Directional Spread** | The average variance in the direction of the velocity vectors throughout the video; calculated by taking the unit velocity vectors described in the ***Mean Flow Direction***, then the calculating the length of the mean vector for each flow field. Using the definition of circular variance, the variance is then averaged over all frames. |
| **Velocity Correlation Length** | The distance $r$ where the average correlation in velocity between two pixels separated by distance $r$ drops below $0.5$, averaged over all flow fields; calculated using direct computation with the formula $\frac{\langle V(r) \cdot V(0)\rangle}{\langle \|V(0)\|^2\rangle}$ |
| **Divergence** | The average spatial divergence of the cumulative velocity field, used to describe local expansion or contraction in the flow field |
| **Curl** | The average curl of the normalized velocity field, used to describe local rotational motion in the flow field |
### Intensity Distribution Metrics
The Intensity Distribution module computes a intensity distribution histogram for all selected frames by the user. The histogram counts are normalized to provide a probability distribution of pixel intensity values, with intensity values with a probability below a user-defined noise threshold (defined [above](#intensity-distribution-settings)) being set to zero. From this intensity probability distribution, the kurtosis, median skewness (defined for a given histogram as $3 * \frac{\text{mean} - \text{median}}{\text{standard deviation}}$), and mode skewness (defined for a given histogram as $3 * \frac{\text{mean} - \text{mode}}{\text{standard deviation}}$). The following metrics are computed with respect to these definitions.
| Metric | Description |
| - | - |
| **Maximum Kurtosis** | The maximum kurtosis in the selected frames -- calculated by taking the top 10% of kurtosis values for the selected frames and averaging over those |
| **Maximum Median Skewness** | The maximum median skewness in the selected frames -- calculated in a similar manner to ***Maximum Kurtosis***. |
| **Maximum Mode Skewness** | The maximum mode skewness in the selected frames of the video -- calculated in a similar manner to ***Maximum Kurtosis***. |
| **Kurtosis Change** | The change in kurtosis between the beginning and the end of the video, calculated in a similar manner to the ***Maximum Island Area Change*** |
| **Median Skewness Change** | The change in the median skewness between the beginning and end of the video, calculated in a similar manner to the ***Kurtosis Change*** |
| **Mode Skewness Difference** | The change in the mode skewness between the beginning and end of the video, calculated in a similar manner to the ***Kurtosis Change*** |

## Output Files
The BARCODE program saves multiple outputs during the course of the analysis.
**Summary:** At the base level, the BARCODE program outputs a CSV file containing a 1x28 matrix for each video channel analyzed in a given dataset. Each matrix contains an entry listing the name of the video file being analyzed, followed by the channel analyzed for the given file -- in the case of the "Parse All Channels" setting being selected, this results in one entry for each distinct channel in a given video file. This is followed by the "Flags" parameter, which lists potential issues that BARCODE may have encountered within the dataset -- the meaning of these flags is described below. Following this is the 1x25 matrix describing the outputs of BARCODE's 3 branches. Any branch that is not used will have NaN (Not a Number) values populating the corresponding metrics for that branch.

  - **Flags:** The Flag column indicates potential issues with the reliability of some outputs. These flags should be checked when interpreting the barcode and summary CSV output.  
    - **Flag = 0:** No warning was detected.
    - **Flag = 1:** Dim file or channel - defined as videos where the first frame has a minimum pixel intensity greater than or equal to 2/e times the mean pixel intensity of the corresponding frame. This can affect the accuracy of all three branches, and is therefore listed to give users insight as to the reliability of BARCODE's output for that file.
    - **Flag = 2:** Saturated file or channel - if the mode of the pixel intensity distribution coincides with the maximum intensity bin of the histogram in every analyzed frame. If even one analyzed frame does not satisfy this condition, no saturation warning is reported.  This can affect the accuracy of the Intensity Distribution branch, and is therefore only shown if the Intensity Distribution branch is used.
    - **Flag = 3:** Structural image autocorrelation (SIA) correlation length exceeds the field of view in at least one analyzed frame.
    - **Flag = 4:** Velocity correlation length exceeds the field of view in at least one analyzed frame.

- **Summary Barcode:** The BARCODE program can also output a visual representation of the data metrics described in the Summary file above. For each metric, this is done by normalizing the metric values using a combination of predetermined limits and the extrema values for a given metric to a 0-1 scale. These normalized values are then plotted using the Matplotlib color map "Plasma". These visualizations are separated by channel for ease of visualization.

- **Visualizations:** The program can also output graphs for visualization of the analysis performed by the modules. The binarization module provides a graph plotting the change in the area of the largest island and void over the video; the intensity distribution module provides a histogram of the pixel intensities of the first and last frames of the video. These two graphs are saved in a file labeled "Summary Graphs.png". Additionally, the binarization module outputs 3 images comparing the first, middle, and final frames before and after binarization, saved as "Binarization Frame *X* Comparison.png", where *X* is the number of the video frame displayed. This can help validate the accuracy of the binarization with a given binarization threshold. The optical flow module similarly outputs 3 flow fields, representing the first, middle, and last flow fields computed with optical flow, and saved as "Frame *X1* to *X2* Flow Field.png", with *X1* and *X2* being the frames between which the flow field was computed. 2-dimensional plots showing the spatial and velocity correlation are also saved as "Frame *X* Structural Correlation" and "Frame *X1* to *X2* Flow Field Velocity Correlation" respectively.

- **Reduced Data Structures:** The program will also output the reduced data structures used to perform the analysis, including the binarized frames of the video for the binarization module, the flow fields for the optical flow module, and the intensity distributions for the intensity distribution module, as well as the radial distributions of the intensity and velocity correlations, from both the binarization and intensity distribution modules, respectively. All three of these are saved in CSV file format, and are comparatively small, with the largest files being at most 1-10 MB.

The visualizations and reduced data structures are saved in a folder titled ```{name of file} BARCODE Output```, saved in the same folder as the file, within a subfolder for each channel evaluated. The summary and barcode are saved in the root folder where the program is running.
